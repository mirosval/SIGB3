\section{Conclusion}

Overall we think that the techniques we have been presented with during the course and that are described in the individual parts of this report have greatly contributed to deepening of our knowledge in the fields of computer graphics and image analysis. They give us the fundamental toolbox that we can build upon in our further academic work, or practical life. 

We have built an eye tracker that is capable to perform pupil and iris detection under certain conditions, and we have gained better understanding of how complicated it is to build a well performing piece of software in this area, that performs well under all conditions.

We have also gained a better understanding of the intricate mathematics behind the 3D projection and lighting. While by no means complete, our understanding can now build upon the foundation we have obtained during the work on the last two assignments.

Only time will tell where we can go with what we have begun to discover during this course.
