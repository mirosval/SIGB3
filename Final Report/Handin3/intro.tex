\section{Introduction}

This assignment has been divided to two main parts: drawing a cube and shading it. In the first part the emphasis was more on the mathematics behind the camera calibration, homographies and projections, whereas in the second part we have focused on calculating shading of the textured cube. similarly to the previous assignments, we used Python and OpenCV as a toolkit.

In the following text we describe the steps we took to complete the assignments. Each step is building on top of  the previous in a natural progression. We begin by describing how we used camera calibration to establish world coordinates, next we describe the steps necessary to project a wireframe cube into this world, followed by projecting a textured version of the cube, and backface culling to remove the faces not visible from the camera perspective.

In the second part of the assignment we enhance the textured cube from the first part by applying the Phong shading algorithm for a single light source
