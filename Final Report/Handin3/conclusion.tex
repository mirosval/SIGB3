\section{Conclusion}
In this assignment we have worked with various techniques that are in use in the field of computer graphics. We have looked at how homographies are useful in calculating camera projection matrices and how those matrices are useful in projecting 3D world onto a 2D image. We have tried out texturing a 3D object and we have explored the intricate mathematics of shading models. We found it very useful and applicable in many areas, such as augmented reality, 3D programming, etc. In the end we have been successful in implementing all the methods and techniques described, and we have deepened our knowledge of the 3D concepts in use.
