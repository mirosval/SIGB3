\section{Conclusion}
In the beginning we have set out to build an eye tracker. We have constructed an eye tracker by iteratively building up detectors for pupil, iris and glints. We have described this process in the Method section. Next, we have built a test suite to evaluate the results we got from our eye tracker. We have talked about this in the Results chapter, where we also discussed the performance of the algorithm both in terms of speed and accuracy.
The overall result that we have managed to achieve with our algorithm is 42 (75\%) of correctly identified pupils/iris on our challenging sample of 56 tested images.In conclusion, we can therefore state that our eye tracker is performing reasonably well in terms of accuracy, but is experimenting some lacks in terms of speed of execution, where it still has some problems. Most of these problems can most likely be solved by re-architecting the code to reuse already performed computations and remember results between frames.
