\section{Introduction}

This assignment has been divided to two parts and we are going to write two reports for this one. In the first part of the assignment we were tasked to learn more about the mathematics behind the camera calibration and computer graphics. Like the two previous assignments, to obtain our goal we used Python and OpenCV as a toolkit. The purpose for this part of the assignment was to be able to use the camera matrix to map the points from a coordinate system to another in a hierarchy of the coordinate systems (world, camera, object).

In this assignment we covered some uses of camera matrix and our result for this part of the assignment was the augmentation of a pattern plane in front of the camera. We mapped a cube with a texture map that can move with the plane movement and seems like it has been attached to the plane.
