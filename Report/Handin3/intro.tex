\section{Introduction}

This assignment has been divided to two part and we are going to write two reports for this one. In the first part of the assignment we were tasked to know more about the mathematics behind the camera calibration and computer graphics. Like the two previous assignment, to obtain our goal we used Python and OpenCV as a toolkit. The purpose for this part of the assignment is to be able to use the camera matrix to map the point from a coordinate system to another in a hierarchy of the coordinates systems (world, camera, object).

In this assignment we covered some used of camera matrix and our result for this part of the assignment was an augmentation on a pattern plane in front of the camera. We mapped a cube with a texture map that can move with the plane movement and seems like it has been attached to the plane.
