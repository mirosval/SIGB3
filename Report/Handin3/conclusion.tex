\section{Conclusion}
In the beginning we continued our work with camera calibration and calculating the camera matrix from the last assignment to get used to work with camera parameters. Then we moved to the main part of this assignment that was projecting and texture mapping. The challenges we faced in this part were working with different methods for projecting a cube. We had a successful achievement on implementing one of the methods but on the other one, we were unsuccessful.

In the last section of the first part of this assignment we worked on improving the performance and accuracy of our implementation by removing the texture faces that are hidden in the current perspective.  The biggest challenge was to find which faces are shown on the current view and removing the hidden ones.

We had a successful achievement on working with camera parameters and texture mapping. Texture mapping and augmentation were really excitement and useful. Surely one day it would be hard to realise the difference between reality and augmented reality.
