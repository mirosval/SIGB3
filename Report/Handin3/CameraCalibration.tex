\section{Camera Calibration}
In this part we calibrated the camera and then loaded the calibration data that has been stored. Next we calculated the camera matrix for the first view of the calibration.
\begin{equation}
	P_{1} = K
	\begin{bmatrix} R_{1}|t_{1} \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
 After these steps we tried to check if P\textsubscript{1} is correct by projecting chesspattern points on the first camera view. As you can see in the \ref{fig:chesspattern} all the points have been projected exactly into the right position.

 In the last step of this part we tried to undistort the image by using the (cv2.undistort) function. (see figure \ref{fig:undistort})
